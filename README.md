Partner mini project for Intro to Data Science (STAT.220). My partner and I created a webpage that displays our analysis and the interactive graphs we created to analyze some of the top MLB players from the 2022 season. All of the web scraping for the data, the data analysis and creation of graphs was done in mini_project_2.Rmd.
